        <p class="description">
          The Pomodoro Widget is a minimalist, desktop timer built as an Electron app with React and Vite. 
          Inspired by the Pomodoro technique, it helps users manage focused work sessions and breaks with a 
          distraction-free floating widget. Designed to stay on top, blend into the desktop, and look aesthetically 
          cohesive, the widget is lightweight and fully cross-platform.

        <p class="label-text">Project Objectives:</p>
        <p class="description">
          My goal was to build a practical tool that I could actually use every day while studying or coding. 
          I wanted it to feel less like a separate window and more like part of my workspace. It had to be small, 
          non-intrusive, yet visually appealing. This project also challenged me to combine front-end React development 
          with Electron, handle window behavior, and explore desktop app distribution.

          <p class="thirds-label">React + Vite</p>
          <p>
            React provided the perfect foundation for building an interactive and state-driven timer, while Vite made 
            development lightning-fast with hot reloading. React’s component-based architecture let me build reusable 
            parts like the landing screen, timer display, and buttons. I chose React over vanilla JS to keep the code 
            organized, testable, and scalable.

        </div>
    
        <div class="inner-third">
          <p class="thirds-label">Electron</p>
          <p>
            I used Electron to wrap the React app into a desktop widget. Electron let me control window properties 
            like transparency, always-on-top behavior, and custom sizing. I also built a preload script to safely bridge 
            front-end JavaScript with native Electron APIs, allowing the exit button to close the widget.
          </p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="outer-third">
          <p class="thirds-label">CSS</p>
          <p>
            Custom CSS made it possible to create a clean, modern look that fits any desktop background. 
            I avoided large frameworks to keep the app lightweight, and used CSS for styling buttons, typography, 
            and transitions. Special care was taken to hide scrollbars and remove window whitespace so the widget 
            feels like it's seamlessly floating.

        <p class="label-text">Challenges and Solutions:</p>
        <p class="description">
          One major challenge was getting the widget to appear truly frameless and transparent on all platforms 
          while still remaining interactive. Electron’s transparent windows sometimes conflict with system themes 
          or GPU acceleration, so I had to carefully test settings like <code>transparent</code>, <code>frame</code>, 
          and <code>alwaysOnTop</code>.
          <br><br>
          Another challenge was securely connecting the front end to Electron's main process. By writing a preload script 
          and exposing only a minimal API with <code>contextBridge</code>, I kept the renderer process isolated for safety.
          Finally, keeping the timer responsive and visually consistent across resolutions meant tweaking CSS dimensions 
          and using flexbox for layout.

        <p class="description">
          The final widget is a polished, fully functional Pomodoro timer that floats on the desktop. It lets users 
          choose between study modes, start/pause sessions, and easily exit when finished. Lightweight and elegant, 
          it serves as a daily productivity companion without feeling like another app window.

        <p class="description">
          In the future, I'd like to add an option to change the timer sounds. I'd also explore saving session history 
          locally, so users can track productivity over time, and maybe add subtle animations to mark breaks.
