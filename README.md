# 🫧 Delia Holman's Portfolio

Welcome to my little corner of the internet!

This is my personal portfolio website - a curated digital garden where I showcase my work, talk a little about who I am, and have fun with UI/UX. Whether you’re here to browse, recruit, or just stumbled upon this repo — welcome! 👋

## ✨ About the Site

Built with love (and lots of CSS), this portfolio reflects my interest in **front-end development**, **UI/UX design**, and **making the web more delightful**.  
I wanted the design to feel personal, a little playful, and very me!

## 🪼 Features

- 🧘‍♀️ Projects I have completed, and even ones that I am still working on!
- 🪐 Responsive layout (looks good on phones, too!)
- 🌻 Smooth navigation  
- 🌐 Easy-to-update content  

## 🎧 Running Locally

```
